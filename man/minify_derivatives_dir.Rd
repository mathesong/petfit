\title{Minify Derivatives Directory for Debugging}
\usage{
minify_derivatives_dir(
  derivatives_dir,
  output_zip = "mini_derivatives.zip",
  size_threshold = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{derivatives_dir}{Character string. Path to the derivatives directory
to minify.}

\item{output_zip}{Character string. Path for the output zip file. Defaults
to "mini_derivatives.zip" in the current working directory.}

\item{size_threshold}{Numeric. File size threshold in MB above which files
will be replaced with empty files. Default is 1 MB.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the created zip file.
}
\description{
Creates a lightweight copy of a derivatives directory by replacing files
larger than 1MB with empty files, then zips the result. Useful for creating
shareable directory structures for debugging without large data files.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Creates a temporary copy of the derivatives directory structure
\item Identifies all files larger than the size threshold (default 1MB)
\item Replaces large files with empty files of the same name
\item Creates a zip archive of the minified directory
\item Cleans up temporary files
}

The resulting zip file preserves the complete directory structure and all
file names, making it useful for debugging configuration and file detection
issues without transferring large data files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create minified version of derivatives directory
minify_derivatives_dir("/path/to/derivatives")

# Custom output location and size threshold
minify_derivatives_dir(
  derivatives_dir = "/path/to/derivatives",
  output_zip = "~/debug_derivatives.zip",
  size_threshold = 0.5  # 500KB threshold
)
}
