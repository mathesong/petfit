# Environment variables for Docker user configuration
# Copy this file to .env and modify as needed

# User and group IDs for running containers
# Use your host system's user and group IDs to prevent permission issues
# Find your IDs with: id -u (user ID) and id -g (group ID)

USER_ID=1000
GROUP_ID=1000

# Example: To use your current user automatically, you can set:
# USER_ID=$(id -u)
# GROUP_ID=$(id -g)

# Note: The defaults (1000:1000) work for most single-user Linux systems
# but you may need to adjust for multi-user systems or different distributions
